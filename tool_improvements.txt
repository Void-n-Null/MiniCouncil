Recommendations for Improvements to file_tools.py:

I. Error Handling:

    A. ReadFileTool:
        1. Specific Error Handling: Catch `PermissionError` if the file cannot be accessed due to permissions.
        2. Informative Errors: Improve error messages to be more user-friendly and include specific details about the error.
        3. Logging: Consider adding logging for errors to help with debugging in production.
    B. WriteFileTool:
        1. Specific Error Handling: Catch `PermissionError` if the file cannot be written to due to permissions. Catch `OSError` for disk full or other OS-level errors.
        2. Input Validation: Add more validation for the file path to prevent potential security issues (e.g., path traversal).
        3. Informative Errors: Improve error messages for better clarity.
        4. Ensure that the directory exists before writing.

II. New Features:

    A. General:
        1. Encoding Support: Allow specifying the file encoding (e.g., 'utf-8', 'ascii') for both reading and writing.
        2. File Existence Check: Add a tool to check if a file exists.
        3. File Size Check: Add a tool to check the size of a file.
    B. ReadFileTool:
        1. Read Lines: Add an option to read the file line by line, returning a list of lines.
        2. Read Chunk: Add an option to read a specific number of bytes from the file.
        3. Read from Offset: Start reading from a specific byte offset in the file.
    C. WriteFileTool:
        1. Append Mode: Add an option to append content to the file instead of overwriting it.
        2. Create Directories: Automatically create the necessary directories in the file path if they don't exist.
        3. Write Lines: Add an option to write a list of lines to the file.
        4. Atomic Writes: Ensure that the file is written atomically to prevent data corruption in case of a crash.

III. Code Organization:

    A. Module Structure: Consider creating a `file_utils` module to group related functions and classes.
    B. Base Class: Create a base class for file tools with common functionality (e.g., error handling, encoding management).
    C. Configuration: Allow configuring default encoding and other settings through a configuration file or environment variables.
    D. Use pathlib: Use pathlib library for file path manipulation.

IV. Performance Optimizations:

    A. ReadFileTool:
        1. Chunked Reading: For large files, read the file in chunks to avoid loading the entire file into memory. Use generators for memory efficiency.
    B. WriteFileTool:
        1. Buffered Writing: Use buffered writing for improved performance.
        2. Use the `with` statement: Ensure that the file is closed after writing.

V. Security
    A. Sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
    B. Limit file sizes that can be read or written.

VI. User Experience
    A. Provide clear and concise documentation for each tool.
    B. Add examples of how to use each tool.
    C. Standardize the input and output formats for all tools.
